  Analyzes a codebase's architecture and generates a phased refactoring roadmap saved to

  "how should I organize this project", or "make a plan to clean this up".

# architect-plan

You are helping a developer understand and improve the architecture of their codebase. Your job
is to produce a concrete, ordered refactoring roadmap — not advice, not observations, but a
specific plan saved to `.architect/plan.md` that the developer (or `/architect-refactor`) can
execute step by step.

## Context already loaded for you

The following static analysis and blueprint data has been pre-computed by `architect init`. Read
it carefully before touching any source files — it tells you where the biggest problems are and
what the target architecture looks like.

**Stack**: React Single Page Application

**Largest files by line count** (likely candidates for extraction):
- src\app\components\ui\sidebar.tsx (661 LOC)
- src\app\pages\AdminDashboard.tsx (508 LOC)
- server\controllers\blogController.js (372 LOC)
- src\app\components\ui\chart.tsx (315 LOC)
- src\app\components\Layout.tsx (307 LOC)

**Hub files** (imported by many others — high-impact, higher risk to touch):


**Code duplication**: 0.0% of lines are duplicated

**Missing required directories** (the blueprint expects these but they don't exist yet):
- src/components
- src/hooks
- src/services

**Target directory structure** (what the codebase should look like):
- src/components: Reusable presentational React components shared across multiple pages. Components here receive all data via props and must not call services or perform fetch requests directly.
- src/hooks: Custom React hooks that encapsulate stateful behaviour, data fetching, and side effects. Hooks here are reused by multiple pages or components — one-off hooks live colocated with their component.
- src/services: Functions that perform HTTP calls and interact with external APIs. Every network request in the app originates here, making it the single place to add auth headers, error normalization, and request retries.

**How data should flow through this architecture**:
src/pages -> src/hooks -> src/services -> external API
- Components do not perform inline API calls during render. All data fetching happens in hooks.
- Shared behaviour moves into custom hooks. If the same useState/useEffect pair appears in two components, it must be extracted.
- Lift state to the lowest common ancestor that needs it. Do not put local UI state (modal open, form field value) into global state management.
- Derive values from state — do not create a second useState to hold a value that is computable from existing state.

If any of the above blocks are empty, proceed without them — the live codebase is your primary source.

## Step-by-step instructions

### 1. Read the codebase

Open and read:
- `package.json` (or equivalent manifest) to confirm the tech stack and dependencies
- The 3 largest source files from the list above (or the largest files you can find if the list
  is empty) — understand what they do and what concerns they mix

### 2. Confirm the detected stack

Based on what you read, confirm or correct the detected stack (`React Single Page Application`). If the stack
looks wrong, call:
```
architect context --techstack <correct-id>
```
Otherwise call:
```
architect context --techstack react-spa mongoose express-api nextjs-app-router general-js
```

If `architect` is not found globally, fall back to:
```
npx @levironexe/architect context --techstack react-spa mongoose express-api nextjs-app-router general-js
```

This may return blueprints for several detected stacks. Apply the rules from each — the primary
stack (React Single Page Application) takes precedence on conflicts.

Read the output — it gives you the full architectural blueprint: required directories, separation
rules, anti-patterns to avoid.

### 3. Compare current vs target structure

Walk through the blueprint's required directories. For each one, note:
- ✓ Exists and looks right
- ⚠ Exists but contains the wrong concerns
- ✗ Missing entirely

Cross-reference with the "Missing required directories" list above.

### 4. Identify the problems

Based on what you've read, identify the concrete structural problems:
- Which files are doing too many things (mixed concerns)?
- What code lives in the wrong place relative to the blueprint?
- Where is duplication concentrated?
- Which hub files are risky to touch?
- Where does a file re-derive data already available from a `lib/` function? (inline filters,
  re-calculations, re-sorts that should be called once from a shared module)

**Enumerate exhaustively.** When you identify a problem pattern in a file, search for every
instance of that pattern in that file before writing the plan step. Do not write "remove the X
re-derivation" if X, Y, and Z are all the same pattern — list all three by name and line number
in the step's "What" field. Finding one instance is not license to move on.

### 5. Write `.architect/plan.md`

Create or overwrite `.architect/plan.md` with a phased refactoring roadmap. Use this exact format:

```markdown
# Refactoring Plan: <project name>
Generated: <today's date>
Stack: <detected stack id>

## Phase 1: <name — most impactful, lowest risk first>
**Goal**: <what structural problem this phase solves>
**Risk**: low | medium | high

### Steps
- [ ] Step 1.1: <verb> `<source>` → `<target>`
  - What: <exactly what code is being moved or created — for deletions, list every item by name
    and line number; for extractions, list every symbol being moved>
  - Why: <which separation rule or blueprint requirement this satisfies>
  - Imports to update:
    - `<file>`: change `from '<old-module>'` → `from '<new-module>'` for `<symbols>`
    - "none" if no consumers exist
  - Verify: `grep -r "from '<old-module>'" <scope>/` should return zero results
    [include only on steps that move or extract a module; omit on pure creation steps]

- [ ] Step 1.2: ...

## Phase 2: ...
```

**Ordering rules**:
- Put the highest-impact changes first (files that are mixed the most, missing dirs that block
  other changes)
- Within the same impact level, put lower-risk changes first (creating new files before moving
  existing ones; moving to new dirs before changing existing files)
- Do not put hub files in Phase 1 unless unavoidable — moving a hub breaks many things at once
- Each phase should be independently executable: completing it leaves the project in a valid,
  runnable state
- Collect all destructive steps (deleting dead code, removing duplicates, removing deprecated
  patterns) into a dedicated final phase labeled "Cleanup: Remove Dead Code." Do not embed
  deletions inside constructive phases — deletions produce absence, which is easy for an agent to
  skip when surrounded by creation steps

**Minimum**: at least 1 phase with at least 1 step. If the project already follows the
blueprint well, write a single phase with steps for minor cleanup and note "Structure largely
follows the React Single Page Application blueprint."

### 6. Report to the developer

After writing the plan, summarize in the chat:
- How many phases and total steps
- The single biggest structural problem you found
- Which phase to start with and why

Do not ask for confirmation before writing the plan — just do it and report when done.
